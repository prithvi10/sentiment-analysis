W DELHI: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on the Narendra Modi government, saying it has launched a "'Fair and Lovely Yojana' to convert black money into white".
Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi said: "Nobody who has black money will be jailed under Modi's 'Fair and Lovely' scheme. All those who have black money can make it white under this scheme."
The Congress vice-president was participating in the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President's address, marking the beginning of the Budget session.
He hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi: "Modi ji had promised that he will put people with black money behind bars, now they have come up with way to save those people."
"I was shocked to see finance minister Arun Jaitley launching such scheme."
He said the Prime Minister had failed to fulfil his poll promise of bringing back black money from foreign countries.
Gandhi also raked up the issue of suicide of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula and said the Prime Minister neither called up his mother nor did he speak on the issue.
He also targeted the Prime Minister for his silence over the violence with students and media personnel at a Delhi court.
